A game by Owen Ryan. \n\n In The Necromancer's Guide to the Apocalypse you play as a Necromancer who has awoken from his centuries long slumber to wreak a terrible vengence on the modern world. Unfortunately while they were sleeping the world has already come to an end. Civilization lies in ruins and hordes of undead wander the wasteland preying on what few living survivors remain.[PAGE BREAK] Using your mastery of necromancy you converted the first zombie you saw, a preper named Andy, into a mindless skelatal trall to assist you. However, Andy's will was a bit stronger than you expected and your first minion was anything but mindless as Andy quickly showed you who's really calling the shots in this partnership.\n\nAnd so with only Andy, your not-so-complete power over death itself and a journal you'll be keeping an entirely un-exaggerated record of your travels in, you wander off into the wasteland. Andy, in search of the zombified remains of his family, and you in search of a purpose in this new world. [PAGE BREAK]You may notice some incomplete features and bugs in this very early version of the game. Currently the game contains:\n\t-2 Enemy Types\n\t-8 encounters\n\t-6 abilties\n\t-5 weapons\n\t-1 necromancer ability\n\t-A map with no procedural generation\n\t-No saving\n\t-No flinching mechanics\n\t-Placeholder artwork\n\t-And a ham-fisted text dump in place of a proper tutorial\n\nIf you have any important feedback or bugs to report you can contact me at: owenryanul@gmail.com [PAGE BREAK] [BUTTON](EXIT){Move on} "
