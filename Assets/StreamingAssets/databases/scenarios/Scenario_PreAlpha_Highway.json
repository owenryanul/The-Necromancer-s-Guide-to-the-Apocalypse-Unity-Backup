    "journelText": "Traveling through the wastes, Andy led us onto an aptly named \"High Way\". The long, straight raised road provided an easy means of progress for a time. Eventually the high arrived at and passed under what I assume was an Even Higher Way. As we made to pass under it, we spotted a horde moving down the even higher way towards us. It was only a matter of time before they spotted us and clambered down. \n [BUTTON](Scenario_PreAlpha_Highway_A){ Andy suggested igniting some of our ammo around the road's support to collapase the road under the front of the horde. A sound idea which I'm glad I though of.} \n\n\n\n\n [BUTTON](BATTLE_PreAlpha Highway Horde1[_]PostBattle_PreAlpha_Highway){We doubled back and formed up, ready to let the foe come to us without their height advantage.}"
