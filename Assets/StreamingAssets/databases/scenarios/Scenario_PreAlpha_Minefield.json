We, of course, had no need of ores and I told Andy as much. \n\nAfter removing his palm from his face Andy explained that what lay before us was a field of half-buried explosives that we would have to carefully pick our way through. However, as we stood plotting our route throught the field, we heard the tell-tale sounds of a horde approaching from behind. [PAGE BREAK] \"Quick through the field, we'll let the mines deal with them.\" Andy shouted.  \n\n [BUTTON](Scenario_PreAlpha_Minefield_A){We carefully picked our way across the field, hoping to lure the horde to their doom.} \n\n\n [BUTTON](BATTLE_PreAlpha Minefield Horde[_]Scenario_PreAlpha_Minefield_B){I turned to face the horde. This \"Minefield\" was too valuable a resource to waste on this measely rabble.}  "
