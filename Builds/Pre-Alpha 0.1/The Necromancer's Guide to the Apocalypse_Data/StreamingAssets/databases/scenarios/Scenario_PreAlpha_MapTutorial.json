    "journelText": "Welcome to the map tutorial. You are currently on the map screen, this screen handles your party moving from location to location in the wasteland, as well as inventory management, minion customisation and non-combat encounters via the journal system. \n\nYour goal in the final game will be to make your way through the map towards a final end point while keeping your necromancer alive. However in this version there is no end goal, instead just a series of encounters you can loop between endlessly.[PAGE BREAK]On the map you can move the camera by moving the mouse to the edges of the screen, and you can move your necromancer to a new location by clicking on it. Moving to a new location automatically triggers any events at that location. Note, you may only move between locations connected by lines. [PAGE BREAK]You have 2 resources in the game, Dark Energy and Ammo. Dark Energy, which is used as your necromancer's health and spent to summon minions. It can gained by killing enemies or through events on the map screen. Ammo is used for casting some abilities and is gained through events on the map screen. [PAGE BREAK]You have an inventory, open and closed by clicking the book mark in the bottom left. In the inventory you can see your current dark energy, your current ammo and your current roster of minions.\n\nYou can customise your minions name, weapons and appearance by clicking on their icon in the roster in your inventory. In addition, you'll also be able to see the minions HP, summon cost and abilties, on this screen, all of which are determined when the minion is created and cannot be changed. \n [BUTTON](EXIT){Move on}"
