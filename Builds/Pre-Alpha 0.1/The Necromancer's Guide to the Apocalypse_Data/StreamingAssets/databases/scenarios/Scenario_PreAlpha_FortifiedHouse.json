Andy suggested proceeding with caution and so I: \n\n [BUTTON](Scenario_PreAlpha_FortifiedHouse_A){Heeded his advice and advanced cautiously into the building} \n\n [BUTTON](Scenario_PreAlpha_FortifiedHouse_B){Ignored his blubbering and strode confidently into the building} \n\n [BUTTON](EXIT){Dismised the house as a waste of time and moved on}"
